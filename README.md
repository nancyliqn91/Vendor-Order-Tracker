# Vendor Order Tracker

#### By _Qian Li_ ðŸ˜Š

#### This is my second c# project which demonstrates uses of MVC routes. 

## Technologies Used

* C#
* Microsoft.NET.Sdk
* MSTest
* VS code

## Description

It will serve as an MVC application to help track the vendors that purchase goods and the orders belonging to those vendors. A user should be able to enter the information of rendor and order, and see the final tracked information.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repo "Vendor-Order-Tracker" from the repository to your desktop.
* Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "VendorOrderTracker". 
* Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
* Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. 
* You can enter the information of rendor and order, and see the final tracked information.
* To optionally run the test, open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's test directory called "VendorOrderTracker.Tests".
